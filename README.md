# FittsLaw
This project implements an experiment to validate Fitts' Law: $MT = a + b \cdot \log_2(\frac{2D}{W} + 1)$. Using a p5.js interface, user interaction data (Movement Time, Distance, Target Width) to calculate the Index of Difficulty and perform linear regression to determine the constants: delay and acceleration
